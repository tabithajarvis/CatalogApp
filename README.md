# Catalog Web App

## About
This project provides a catalog database interface to create, read, update, and delete catalog items from different categories.

## To Run
- This project requires the database to be set up.  To do this, run `python cdb_setup.py` in the project folder.

- If you are using vagrant to host this webserver and database, run `vagrant up` in the project folder, and `vagrant ssh` once that completes to connect to the virtual machine.
```

Now you can start the webserver by running `python server.py`
